Row, row, row your boat, \
Gently down the stream, \
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily \
***Life is but a dream.***

Keep on listening, but do not perceive; \
Keep on looking, but do not understand. \
***Life is but a parable.***

As the interpreter interprets the meaning of a dream, the gifted decode the parable of life. \
The prophet, seeing from the end, sees things as they are. \
The artist, seeing from beauty, sees things as they are. \
The author, seeing from pattern, sees things as they are.

Yet, life remains a shadow. \
An empty outline. \
The Light covers all, but we remain blind. 

We do not love as we are loved, \
We do not hope as we have hope, \
We do not believe as we should believe. \
We are far too content with the shadows the fire casts on the cave walls.

Yet, the dawn is coming, \
The dark is breaking. \
He who was, and is, and is to come, is coming.

***For nothing is hidden that will not become evident, nor anything secret that will not be known and come to light.***
