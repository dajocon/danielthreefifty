Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. (Deuteronomy 22:11)

The tapestry is woven. \

Threads of rumination, of fear. \
Mixed fabrics smuggled from alien looms. \
Worn in the mind like a tainted robe.

What communion has light with darkness? \
Our citizenship is in Heaven: \
Hope, joy, peace, love. 

Burn the mixed fabric. \


Does the garment say to the tailor, “What are you weaving?” \

He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments \ 
And He who is, shall testify his name before His Father.
