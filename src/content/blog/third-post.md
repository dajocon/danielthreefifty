Do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together. (Deuteronomy 22:11)

The tapestry is being woven. \
The Grand Architect prepares a mansion unseen. \


Thoughts of failure, of worry, of rumination, of fear. \
Fabrics mixed in from alien looms. \


What communion has light with darkness? \
Our citizenship is in Heaven. \
Hope, joy, peace, love. \


Mixed fabrics burned. \
Still clinging to the skin. \
Grumbling fills the grimy air. \


Does the clay say to the potter, “What are you doing?” \
Or doubt the Maker has hands? \
