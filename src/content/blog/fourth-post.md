Job 38:4-7 \
“Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? \
    Tell me, if you understand. \
Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know! \
    Who stretched a measuring line across it? \
On what were its footings set, \
    or who laid its cornerstone— \
while the morning stars sang together \
    and all the angels shouted for joy?”

Tetris is a video game wherein shapes fall from the top of the screen and must be sorted such that on the horizontal axis there are no open spaces. The shapes must be stacked up on the vertical axis, and when the player fills the last space on the horizontal line the player scores points, the line disappears, preventing the pile from overflowing. The player loses when the shapes stack to the top of the screen. 

I posit that Divine Providence works like a skilled Tetris player. God the Father, in His all-knowing love, has planned history such that all events work together for the salvation of those who love Him through the revelation of His Son, which one comes to accept and partake in through the Holy Spirit. There is no “shape” (event that occurs) that falls without working its way to the perfect spot in order to accomplish this goal. **This means that ultimately, all of reality is being orchestrated for the accomplishment of an all powerful love, joy, and peace for those who love God.**

The reason why we feel agitated, frustrated, and suffer is because we do not see how the Tetris Champion is going to fit all the shapes together. But if we trust, we receive great consolation and peace. The reward of doing the right thing is a clear conscience and the peace that comes with it, knowing the pieces will fall into place.
